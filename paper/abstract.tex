On an input bit-vector formula,
a typical SMT solver proceeds by applying several
simplification rules and then bit-blasting.
%
The bit-vector formulas with multiplications
are particularly hard for SMT solvers.
%
Therefore, the simplification more importantly needs
to detect some high level structures
in the input and use it in solving the formulas.
%
In this paper, we present a class of simplifications
that may be needed in solving formulas containing
multiplications and no leading solver implements it, and
an efficient algorithm to recognize the simplification
pattern. 
%
We have added the algorithm in rewriting engine of $\zthree$
and applied on benchmarks.
%
Our modification solves several formulas that are
intractable by any other leading solver.
