%SMT solvers for the theory of fixed-width bit-vectors are widely used.
%
Bit-vector formulas arising from hardware verification problems often
contain word-level arithmetic operations.  Empirical evidence shows
that state-of-the-art SMT solvers are not very efficient at reasoning about
bit-vector formulas with multiplication.  This is particularly true
when multiplication operators are decomposed and represented in
alternative ways in the formula. %% In such cases, the solver may fail
%to identify the word-level
%% multiplication operation and end up bit-blasting..
%% %
%Therefore, it is important for an SMT solver to uses all the structure
%available in the problem, including the word-level reasoning.
%
%
We present a pre-processing heuristic that identifies certain types of
decomposed multipliers, and adds special assertions to the input
formula that encode the equivalence of sub-terms and word-level
multiplication terms.  The pre-processed formulas are then solved using an
SMT solver.  Our experiments with three  SMT solvers
show that our heuristic allows several formulas to be solved quickly,
while the same formulas time out without the pre-processing step.
