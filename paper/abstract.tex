On an input bit-vector formula,
a typical SMT solver proceeds by applying several
simplification rules and then bit-blasting.
%
The bit-vector formulas with multiplications
are particularly hard for SMT solvers.
%
Therefore, it becomes more important that the simplification detects
high level structures in the formulas in order to solve it faster.
%
In this paper, we present a class of simplifications that may be
needed in solving formulas containing multiplications and no leading
solver implements it, and an efficient algorithm to recognize the
simplification pattern. 
%
We have added the algorithm in rewriting engine of $\zthree$
and applied on benchmarks.
%
Our modification solves several formulas that are
intractable by any other leading solver.
