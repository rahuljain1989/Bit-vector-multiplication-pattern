The SMT solvers for the theory of bit-vectors are widely used.
%
The bit-vector formulas often involve word-lever arithmetic
operations.
%
The bit-vector formulas with multiplications
are particularly hard for SMT solvers.
%
Therefore, it is more important that a solver uses all 
the structure available in the problem including the
word-level reasoning.
%
Sometimes multiplications are decomposed and implemented in several
ways and the solver fails to see the word-level multiplication. 
%
In this paper, we present a solver that identifies the decomposed
multipliers, adds theory axioms in the input formula that encodes
equivalence of the decomposed multiplication and the word-level
multiplication, and solves the modified input using an available
solver.
%
We have added the algorithm in rewriting engine of $\zthree$
and applied on benchmarks.
%
Our modification solves several formulas that are
intractable by any other leading solver.
