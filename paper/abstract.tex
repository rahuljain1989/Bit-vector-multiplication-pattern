SMT solvers for the theory of fixed-width bit-vectors are widely used.
%
Bit-vector formulas often involve word-level arithmetic
operations.
%
Empirical evidence shows that bit-vector formulas with multiplication
are often hard for SMT solvers to reason about.
%
Therefore, it is important that an SMT solver uses all 
the structure available in the problem, including the
word-level reasoning.
%
Sometimes multiplication operators are decomposed and implemented in
alternative ways, and the solver fails to identify the word-level
multiplication operation.
%
In this paper, we present a pre-processing heuristic that identifies
the decomposed multipliers, and adds special assertions to the input
formula that encodes equivalence of the decomposed multiplication and
the word-level multiplication.  The pre-processed formulas are then
solved using an available solver.
%
We have implemented our pre-processing algorithms in the rewriting
engine of $\zthree$ and applied these on a suite of benchmarks.
%
Our experiments with three state-of-the-art SMT solvers show that our
heuristic allows several formulas to be solved quickly, while the same
formulas time out without the pre-processing step.
