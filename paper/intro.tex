% Bit-vector is important
Many hardware and software verification problems are translated to the satisfiability
of quantifier free bit-vector(QF\_BV) formulas~\cite{hardware,cbmc,more}.
%
There are several SMT solvers that implement satisfiability of 
QF\_BV formulas, e. g., $\zthree$~\cite{z3}, $\cvcfour$~\cite{cvc4}, 
and many others.
%
A typical SMT solver proceeds by applying several
simplification rules on the input formula.
%
and then bit-blasting.

% Multiplication is widely used
In several applications such as control software multiplication
of bit-vectors is widely used.
%
The bit-vector formulas with multiplications
are particularly hard for SMT solvers.


% A multiplication may be implemented in pieces 


% SMT solvers do not recognize the pieces and the assembly of pieces


% We have a pattern for recognizing multipliers


% Two ways to implement : add as eager theory axioms or rewriting of the inputs


% Implemented in Z3 and benchmark
