% Bit-vector is important
%
Many hardware and software verification problems are translated to the
satisfiability of quantifier free bit-vector(QF\_BV)
formulas~\cite{hardware,cbmc,more}.
%
There are several SMT solvers that implement satisfiability of 
QF\_BV formulas, e. g., $\zthree$~\cite{z3}, $\cvcfour$~\cite{cvc4}, 
and many others.
%
A typical SMT solver proceeds by applying several simplification rules
on the input formula.
%
If the solver can not simplify a formula anymore and then it
translates the formula bit-blasting.

% Multiplication is widely used
%
In several applications, such as control and microprocessor designs,
the multiplications of bit-vectors are widely used.
%
The bit-vector multiplications are particularly hard for SMT solvers.
%

% A multiplication may be implemented in pieces 
%
Since multiplication an expensive operation, it is often broken down
in small pieces and the results are added with appropriates offsets.
%
There are several algorithms for breaking down multiplications, for
example, high-school grade multiplier, \ashu{other multipliers}, Booth
multiplier, etc.
%
If a multiplication is implemented using one of the algorithm then the
solver may not be able to recognize that the net effect of the
algorithm is the multiplication of some bit-vectors.

% SMT solvers do not recognize the pieces and the assembly of pieces


% We have a pattern for recognizing multipliers


% Two ways to implement : add as eager theory axioms or rewriting of the inputs


% Implemented in Z3 and benchmark
