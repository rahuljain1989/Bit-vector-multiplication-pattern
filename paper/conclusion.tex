We have presented two classes of pattern detection for the formulas with
multipliers implemented using long school multiplier and Wallace tree.
%
We have implemented the algorithms and applied to several handcrafted and 
industrial benchmarks.
%
The experiments suggest a significant improvement in performance.

We are currently extending our procedure to support Booth multiplier
and other difficult arithmetic patterns.
%
We are also working to add proof generation support
for the added valid formulas.
%
We could not include proof generation in this work, since basic infrastructure
of proof generation is missing in $\zthree$~bit-vector rewriter module.
%
We are also planning to request \zthree~team to adopt our modification in their
standard distribution.
