We have presented classes of simplifications for the formulas with
multipliers implemented using grade school multiplier and Wallace tree,
and algorithms to apply the simplifications on the formulas.
%
We have implemented the algorithms and applied to several handcrafted and 
industrial benchmarks.
%
The experiments suggest a significant improvement in performance.

We are currently extending our procedure to support Booth multiplier
and other difficult arithmetic patterns that lead to highly simplified
formula.
%
We are planning to request \zthree team to adopt our modification in their
standard distribution.
